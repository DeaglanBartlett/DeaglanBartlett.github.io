I am an [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow](https://saiis.web.ox.ac.uk/home) in the Department of Physics at The Univeristy of Oxford,
where I work on projects at the border of artificial intelligence and Bayesian inference problems, within the framework of applications to cosmology.
I also hold the International Astronomical Union (IAU) [The Gruber Foundation (TGF) Fellowship](https://www.iau.org/Iau/Iau/Science/Grants-and-Prizes/Gruber-Fellowship.aspx) in Astrophysics for 2025/26,
and a Nicholas Kurti Junior Research Fellowship at Brasenose College, Oxford for 2025-2028.

I am interested in statistical and machine learning methodology in astrophysics and cosmology, Bayesian large-scale structure inference, field-level inference, and probing dark energy and constraining dark matter with astronomical surveys.
I also work on accelerating cosmological simulations using machine learning methods and methodological improvements and 
applications of symbolic regression, a machine-learning technique which directly learns analytic laws from data.

I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, where I was supported by the [Simons Foundation on Learning the Universe](https://www.learning-the-universe.org/). I continue to work within this collaboration, and co-lead the Accelerated Forward Modelling working group.

I obtained my DPhil in Astrophysics at Oriel College, Oxford under the supervision of Prof. Pedro Ferreira and Dr Harry Desmond.
I was also the Graduate Teaching and Research Scholar at Oriel College from 2020 to 2022. 
My DPhil research focused on using the morphology and kinematics of galaxies to learn about galaxy formation and to constrain new Physics
(theories beyond the standard models of cosmology (Î›CDM) and particle physics (SM)).
I studied for my MA and MSci in Natural Sciences at Trinity College, University of Cambridge.
For my Part III (Masters) Project, I was supervised by Dr Will Handley, where I worked on 'The Conformal Boundary at the End of the Universe.'
