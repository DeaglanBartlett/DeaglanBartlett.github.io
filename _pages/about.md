I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, having previously obtained my DPhil in Astrophysics under the supervision of Prof. Pedro Ferreira and Dr Harry Desmond. I was also the Graduate Teaching and Research Scholar at Oriel College from 2020 to 2022. I am a member of the Simons Foundation on Learning the Universe and the Aquila Consortium.

I am interested in statistical and machine learning methodology in astrophysics and cosmology, Bayesian large-scale structure inference, field-level inference using BORG (Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies), and probing dark energy and constraining dark matter with astronomical surveys. My DPhil research focused on using the morphology and kinematics of galaxies to learn about galaxy formation and to constrain new Physics. By new Physics I mean theories beyond the standard models of cosmology (Î›CDM) and particle physics (SM). In particular, I investigated whether there are new fields mediating gravitational forces which can manifest themselves as fifth forces and, if so, determine how these fields and forces are screened in different environments.

I previously studied for my MA and MSci at Trinity College, University of Cambridge. For my Part III (Masters) Project, I was supervised by Dr Will Handley, where I worked on 'The Conformal Boundary at the End of the Universe.'
