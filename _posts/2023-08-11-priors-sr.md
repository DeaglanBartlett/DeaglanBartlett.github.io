  If we truly are to automate the scientific process of converting data to equations, we want our algorithms to suggest candidate expressions which a human could have plausibly written down. In this work we compare Bayesian and MDL methods for achieveing this and apply our methods to benchmark problems and a real-world application from cosmology.
