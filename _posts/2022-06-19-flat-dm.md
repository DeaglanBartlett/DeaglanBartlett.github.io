  The identification of dark matter is a crucial task of modern physics. We present a full-sky, field-level search for dark matter annihilation and decay in the large-scale structure of the nearby universe, exploiting more information than conventional analyses targetting specific objects. We find no evidence for such effects, placing new constraints on the rates of dark matter interactions.

# Background

Dark matter makes up ~25% of the universe's mass and is the key component
in structure formation. Our knowledge of dark matter currently comes solely from its
gravitational influence, but revealing its particle nature will require
identifying its other interaction with itself and standard model particles.
Fig 1 shows the three processes that such interactions would allow: production
of dark matter through collision of standard model particles, scattering between dark matter and standard model particles,
and annilihation of dark matter into standard matter particles. Each of these has an associated
detection method: we could produce dark matter in particle colliders ("direct
detection"), see recoils of standard model particles due to incident dark matter ("scattering"), or
identify standard model particles produced by dark matter annihilations ("indirect detection"). A
final possible interaction, included in "indirect detection" but involving only
a single dark matter particle, is the spontaneous decay of dark matter into standard model particles.

We are concerned here with dark matter annihilation and decay. This is typically sought
by identifying astrophysical objects whose kinematics indicate that they are
particularly dark matter-rich, which include the Milky Way, dwarf spheroidal galaxies
(dSphs) in the Local Group and massive clusters further afield. One then targets
these objects with telescopes sensitive to gamma-rays, which the standard model particles
produced by dark matter would be expected to decay into. These searches have enabled us
to rule out a thermal relic origin for WIMP dark matter at low mass, depending
on the annihilation channel. Such methods however have two important
disadvantages:

1. by focusing on specific objects they necessarily miss gamma-rays coming from the interactions of any dark matter not in the objects,
2. they are susceptible to systematic errors due to gamma-rays produced in those objects by non-dark matter, i.e. baryonic, means.

To avoid these potential pitfalls, we instead forward-model the gamma-ray flux
from annihilation and decay pixel-by-pixel across the full sky using BORG-based
models of the large-scale dark matter distribution. This enables a field-level
inference of annihilation and decay rates on comparison with similarly all-sky
data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope.[^paper]

# Predicting annihilation and decay fluxes

Our method leverages CSiBORG (also used in a [previous blog
post](/method/observations/bh_gravity.html)), a suite of 101 high-resolution
N-body simulations with initial conditions spanning the posterior of the [2M++ BORG-PM](/method/borgpm.html)
chain. Each box provides a plausible realisation of the dark matter distribution
out to ~200 Mpc, including the clumping of dark matter into halos. We use this to make a
prediction for the annihilation (decay) flux that would be seen for each line of
sight on the sky for a given annihilation cross-section (decay rate) and
channel, which we then project onto a Healpix grid to match the resolution of
Fermi. This is shown in Fig 2, in terms of the "J-factor" (left) and "D-factor"
(right) that describe the astrophysical contributions to the flux (i.e. without
the particle physics terms). Assuming a Poisson likelihood for the measured flux
in each pixel, and marginalising over the CSiBORG realisations, a model for
substructure within each halo and a set of templates that describes the
contribution from non-dark matter sources, we constrain the parameters of dark matter interactions
using all nearby dark matter that is resolved by CSiBORG.

# Bounding DM interactions

We find no evidence for enhanced gamma-ray flux tracing dark matter density squared, as
would be expected in an annihilation model. This allows us to set constraints on
the cross-section, which we show in Fig 3 (left) as a function of dark matter particle
mass for a range of different annihilation channels. The grey dot-dashed line
shows the thermal relic cross-section, which is the value needed to explain the
current dark matter abundance through thermal freeze-out in the early universe
(the standard production mechanism for WIMPs). Locations where bounds are below
this indicate that the thermal relic scenario is ruled out. The black dashed
line shows a previous constraint from cross-correlation of gamma-ray flux with
the positions of low surface brightness galaxies, and the dotted line is from
dSphs in the Local Group. While these constraints are much stronger than ours
as dSphs are very close leading to large predicted flux (not included in our
analysis because they are below the CSiBORG resolution limit), they are
sensitive to flux contributions from baryonic processes. In our approach,
significant constraining power comes from regions largely devoid of baryons
such as the filaments that connect halos.

The right panel of Fig 3 shows our constraint on the flux due to dark matter decays,
separately for each of Fermi's energy bins. That many are centred away from zero
indicates that we do detect gamma-rays with a flux distribution across the sky
that traces the dark matter density, as expected for decays. However, the spectrum of the
signal is much more closely aligned with a power-law than the expectation from
decay (pink vs red line), suggesting a more mundane, baryonic origin such as
blazars.

In conclusion, we have used BORG to open yet another field -- dark matter indirect
detection -- to full-sky, field-level Bayesian inference. In principle this
allows all the information to be extracted from gamma-ray surveys and thus
represents the most promising astrophysical method for uncovering the
non-gravitational interactions of dark matter.

The grey dot-dashed line is the cross-section of a thermal relic WIMP, and the black dashed and dotted lines show literature constraints from galaxy cross-correlations and Local Group dwarf spheroidals respectively. Right: Flux contribution with the spatial distribution expected from dark matter decay in each Fermi energy bin. The red line is the spectrum expected from decays to $$b\bar{b}$$, while the pink line, preferred by the data, is the best-fit power-law spectrum._
