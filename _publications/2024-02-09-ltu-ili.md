## Abstract
This paper presents the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference (`ltu-ili`) pipeline, 
a codebase for rapid, user-friendly, and cutting-edge machine learning (ML) inference in astrophysics and cosmology. 
The pipeline includes software for implementing various neural architectures, training schema, priors, and density estimators 
in a manner easily adaptable to any research workflow. It includes comprehensive validation metrics to assess posterior estimate coverage, 
enhancing the reliability of inferred results. Additionally, the pipeline is easily parallelizable, designed for efficient exploration of modeling hyperparameters. 
To demonstrate its capabilities, we present real applications across a range of astrophysics and cosmology problems, such as: 
estimating galaxy cluster masses from X-ray photometry; 
inferring cosmology from matter power spectra and halo point clouds; 
characterising progenitors in gravitational wave signals; capturing physical dust parameters from galaxy colors and luminosities; 
and establishing properties of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. 
We also include exhaustive benchmarking and comparisons of all implemented methods as well as discussions about the challenges 
and pitfalls of ML inference in astronomical sciences. All code and examples are made publicly available at [this https URL](https://github.com/maho3/ltu-ili).

Each of the three stages (Data, Inference, Validation) is independently configurable, meaning any setup of one stage will automatically link to the others.*
