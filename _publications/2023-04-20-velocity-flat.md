## Abstract
If dark matter annihilates into standard model particles with a cross-section which is velocity dependent, then Local Group dwarf galaxies will not be the best place to search for the resulting gamma ray emission. A greater flux would be produced by more distant and massive halos, with larger velocity dispersions. We construct full-sky predictions for the gamma-ray emission from galaxy- and cluster-mass halos within $\sim 200 {\rm \, Mpc}$ using a suite of constrained $N$-body simulations (CSiBORG) based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies algorithm. Comparing to observations from the *Fermi* Large Area Telescope and marginalising over reconstruction uncertainties and other astrophysical contributions to the flux, we obtain constraints on the cross-section which are two (seven) orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from dwarf spheroidals for $p$-wave ($d$-wave) annihilation.
We find no evidence for either type of annihilation from dark matter particles with masses in the range $m_\chi = 2-500{\rm \, GeV}/c^2$, for any channel. As an example, for annihilations producing bottom quarks with $m_\chi = 10 {\rm \, GeV}/c^2$, we find $a_{1} < 2.4 \times 10^{-21} {\rm \, cm^3 s^{-1}}$ and $a_{2} < 3.0 \times 10^{-18} {\rm \, cm^3 s^{-1}}$ at 95\% confidence, where the product of the cross-section, $\sigma$, and relative particle velocity, $v$, is given by $\sigma v = a_\ell (v/c)^{2\ell}$ and $\ell=1, 2$ for $p$-, $d$-wave annihilation, respectively.
Our bounds, although failing to exclude the thermal relic cross-section for velocity-dependent annihilation channels, are among the tightest to date.

*95% upper limit on the dark matter $p$-wave (upper, $\ell=1$) and $d$-wave (lower, $\ell=2$) annihilation cross-section parameter, $a_\ell$, where the annihilation cross-section is $\sigma v = a_\ell (v/c)^{2\ell}$. The solid lines and points are from this work. Each constraint is derived at a fixed dark matter particle mass $m_\chi$ as indicated on the $x$-axis. The red dotted line is a constraint obtained from dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Milky Way for the $b\bar{b}$ channel. We find that our constraints are approximately two orders of magnitude tighter than those from dSphs due to the larger velocity dispersions in massive extragalactic halos. The dSph constraint for $d$-wave is off the top of the plot. The brown dashed line is the constraint for the $e^+e^-$ channel, directly detecting the resulting electrons and positrons, assuming they are produced by the galactic halo. This is slightly tighter than our $e^+e^-$ constraint.*
